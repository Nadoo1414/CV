###🎭 Facial Expression Classification using CNN
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify facial expressions into seven emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral. Built using Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and OpenCV, it’s designed to explore the fascinating world of facial recognition in AI.

##🚀 Project Overview
As part of the Computer Vision module from the High Impact Skills Development Program, the goal is simple: to train a model that can read faces and predict their emotional state!

##💼 Dataset
The dataset contains face images labeled with seven emotions, with bounding box info and confidence levels.

##🧠 Model Architecture
A simple yet powerful CNN with layers designed to capture intricate facial details:

Convolutional Layers with ReLU activation
MaxPooling for downsampling
Fully connected Dense layers with Dropout for regularization
Softmax output layer for multi-class classification
